1. Start by updating all the renative dependencies in your project package.json:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@rnv/template-starter": "1.0.0",
    "@rnv/engine-rn": "1.0.0",
    "@rnv/engine-rn-tvos": "1.0.0",
    "@rnv/engine-rn-next": "1.0.0",
    "@rnv/engine-rn-web": "1.0.0",
    "@rnv/engine-rn-electron": "1.0.0",
},
"dependencies": {
    "@rnv/renative": "1.0.0",
}
```

and run `yarn` to update the packages.

2. Make sure any renative versions referenced in your `renative.json` are updated to `1.0.0` as well.

```json
"templates": {
    "@rnv/template-starter": {
        "version": "1.0.0-rc.12"
    }
},
```

3. Update your hooks to use the new imports. Imports have been moved to `@rnv/core` package. For more information you can reffer to [Core's Node API Documentation](api/node/rnv-core/modules). For example, change

```javascript
import { Logger, executeAsync } from 'rnv';
...
Logger.logTask('Hello World');

```

to

```javascript
import { logTask, executeAsync } from '@rnv/core';
logTask('Hello World');
```

4. If your project `renative.json` extends a template (for example `@rnv/template-starter`), make sure the plugins section does not contain any overrides that might impede the upgrade. For example, if you have a plugin override like this:

```json
"plugins": {
    "@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios": "source:rnv",
    "@react-native-community/cli": "source:rnv",
    "react-native-tvos": "source:rnv",
    "react-native-web": "source:rnv",
    "next": "source:rnv"
}
```

you should remove it, as the new versions of the plugins will be inherited from the template. If you have added any custom plugins now is a good time to see if you can update these as well but that is something outside the scope of this guide.

5. Plugin definition structure has changed in 1.0.0. If you have plugins defined in your `renative.json` you should update the structure to the new format. For example, if you have a plugin defined like this:

```json
"plugins": {
    "@mapbox/react-native-mapbox-gl": {
            "android": {
                "implementation": "  implementation (project(':mapbox-react-native-mapbox-gl')) {\n    implementation ('com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.6.0') {\n      force = true\n    }\n  }",
                "package": "com.mapbox.rctmgl.RCTMGLPackage",
                "path": "{{PLUGIN_ROOT}}/android/rctmgl",
                "projectName": "mapbox-react-native-mapbox-gl"
            },
            "ios": {
                "appDelegateImports": ["RNCPushNotificationIOS"],
                "appDelegateMethods": {
                    "application": {
                        "didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError": [
                            "RNCPushNotificationIOS.didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(error)"
                        ],
                        "didReceive": null,
                        "didReceive": ["RNCPushNotificationIOS.didReceive(notification)"],
                        "didReceiveRemoteNotification": [
                            "RNCPushNotificationIOS.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo, fetchCompletionHandler: completionHandler)"
                        ],
                        "didRegister": ["RNCPushNotificationIOS.didRegister(notificationSettings)"],
                        "didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken": [
                            "RNCPushNotificationIOS.didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(withDeviceToken: deviceToken)"
                        ]
                    },
                    "userNotificationCenter": {
                        "willPresent": ["completionHandler([.alert, .badge, .sound])"]
                    }
                },
                "path": "{{PLUGIN_ROOT}}",
                "podName": "RNCPushNotificationIOS"
            },
    }
}

```

Both `ios` and `android` platforms have suffered some changes to the structure. Most properties are now nested under `templateAndroid` or `templateXcode`. For example, the above plugin definition should be updated to:

```json
"plugins": {
    "@mapbox/react-native-mapbox-gl": {
            "android": {
                "templateAndroid": {
                    "implementation": "  implementation (project(':mapbox-react-native-mapbox-gl')) {\n    implementation ('com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.6.0') {\n      force = true\n    }\n  }",
                },
                "package": "com.mapbox.rctmgl.RCTMGLPackage",
                "path": "{{PLUGIN_ROOT}}/android/rctmgl",
                "projectName": "mapbox-react-native-mapbox-gl"
            },
            "ios": {
                "templateXcode": {
                    "appDelegateImports": ["RNCPushNotificationIOS"],
                    "appDelegateMethods": {
                        "application": {
                            "didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError": [
                                "RNCPushNotificationIOS.didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(error)"
                            ],
                            "didReceive": null,
                            "didReceive": ["RNCPushNotificationIOS.didReceive(notification)"],
                            "didReceiveRemoteNotification": [
                                "RNCPushNotificationIOS.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo, fetchCompletionHandler: completionHandler)"
                            ],
                            "didRegister": ["RNCPushNotificationIOS.didRegister(notificationSettings)"],
                            "didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken": [
                                "RNCPushNotificationIOS.didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(withDeviceToken: deviceToken)"
                            ]
                        },
                        "userNotificationCenter": {
                            "willPresent": ["completionHandler([.alert, .badge, .sound])"]
                        }
                    },
                },
                "path": "{{PLUGIN_ROOT}}",
                "podName": "RNCPushNotificationIOS"
            },
    }
}
```

For a full overview of the new plugin definition structure, you can refer to the [Plugin Definition Documentation](api/schemas/rnv.plugin).

**Important** For iOS and tvOS platforms we migrated from Swift to Objective-C. If you have any Swift code injections in your project you should migrate it to Objective-C.

6. Overrides
   Make sure you doublecheck your overrides to make sure you still need them. For example if you override the whole Podfile from `appConfigs/{config}/builds/{platform}/Podfile` from version 0.37 it will break the build. A better approach would be to remove the override (rename it for backup) and see if the build still works. If it does, you can remove the override. If it doesn't, you can check the new Podfile from `platformBuilds` and use that as a baseline for overriding.
