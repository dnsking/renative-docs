## Overview

ReNative allows you to customize, extend or override pretty much anything.

---
## Override file provided by ReNative

Let's imagine you want to override one of the files generated in `./platformBuilds/[APP_ID]_[PLATFORM]/[FILE_PATH]`

you can override any file via `./appConfigs/base/builds/[PLATFORM]/[FILE_PATH]`

---
## Example 1

Webpack config file of your web app (use `.dev.` or `.prod.` to override the config for development or production builds):

`./platformBuilds/helloworld_web/webpack.config.dev.js`

Will be overridden with:

`./appConfigs/base/builds/web/webpack.config.dev.js`

---
## Example 2

Application delegate of your iOS app

`./platformBuilds/helloworld_ios/RNVApp/AppDelegate.swift`

Will be overridden with:

`./projectConfig/builds/ios/RNVApp/AppDelegate.swift`
