### Breaking Changes

iOS Template has been updated to follow new requirements for storyboard based launch screen. More info:  https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01132020b

new launch images should be placed to your assets configs typically:


```
.
└── [appConfigs/<appConfig>/assets/ios/Assets.xcassets/launch-image.imageset]
    ├── launch-image.png
    ├── launch-image@2x.png
    └── launch-image@3x.png

```

Recommended size is 1000x1000, 2000x2000 and 3000x3000 to cover all iOS screen densities
