# rnv.project Schema Definition

The schema defines the following properties:

## `workspaceID` (string)

Workspace ID your project belongs to. This will mach same folder name in the root of your user directory. ie `~/` on macOS

## `projectVersion` (string)

Version of project

## `projectName` (string)

Name of the project which will be used in workspace as folder name. this will also be used as part of the KEY in crypto env var generator

## `isTemplate` (boolean)

Marks project as template. This disables certain user checks like version mismatch etc

## `defaults` (object)

Default system config for this project

Properties of the `defaults` object:

### `ports` (object)

Allows you to assign custom port per each supported platform specific to this project. this is useful if you foten switch between multiple projects and do not want to experience constant port conflicts

### `supportedPlatforms` (array)

Array list of all supported platforms in current project

The object is an array with all elements of the type `string`.

### `portOffset` (number)

Offset each port default value by increment

### `defaultCommandSchemes` (object)

List of default schemes for each rnv command. This is useful if you want to avoid specifying `-s ...` every time your run rnv command. bu default rnv uses `-s debug`. NOTE: you can only use schemes you defined in `buildSchemes`

### `targets` (object)

Override of default targets specific to this project

## `pipes` (array)

To avoid rnv building `buildHooks/src` every time you can specify which specific pipes should trigger recompile of buildHooks

The object is an array with all elements of the type `string`.

## `crypto` (object)

This prop enables automatic encrypt and decrypt of sensitive information in your project. 
RNV will generate new env variable with can be used to encrypt and decrypt. this env var is generated by combining (and sanitizing) 2 properties from your renative.json: 
workspaceID + projectName.
These 2 properties are also used to generate path on your local machine where encrypted files will be decrypted into.

Properties of the `crypto` object:
