    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

```bash
rnv new
```

Follow steps in the terminal

## Run first app

Run your first `ios` app

```bash
rnv run -p ios
```

Run your first `android` app

```bash
rnv run -p android
```

Run your first `web` app

```bash
rnv run -p web
```

... and so on

All app code is located in `./src` directory

## NPX

⚠️

It is recommended that after initial project setup you start using `npx rnv ...` prefix instead of `rnv ...`

This ensures that every project uses correct version of `rnv` to avoid potential compatibility issues

make sure you have npx installed globally via `npm install npx -g`
